# *Bioenergy crops versus food crops: An agent-based modeling study of land-use conflict in Brong-Ahafo region, Ghana*

## Purpose
<!---
Overthe past years, the government of Ghana drafted and planned to adopt biofuel policies such as financial instruments (i.e. biofuel subsidies) and regulatory instruments (i.e. biofuel targets and mandates) to support the biofuel industry. There are growing concerns that this projected growth in the biofuel industry can exacerbate the already existing food security situation in the country. We are developing an agent-based model to study land use conflict between food and bioenergy crop cultivation in Ghana's formerly Brong-Ahafo (i.e. Bono, Ahafo, and Bono-East) region. We will use the model to examine the extent to which farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha (a bioenergy crop) are influenced by their interaction with biofuel companies and other farmers through a common market where harvests are sold, the spatial land-use patterns that emerge from farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha and the implications of the obtained land-use patterns on food security (i.e. maize crop availability). -->

The rising demand for energy in regions of Africa with rapid population growth associated to the dwindling of Earth’s current supply of fossil fuel and erratic rainfall patterns (making hydropower less reliable) pose a great challenge to the energy security of the continent. Bioenergy has been touted as a sustainable alternative to other more impacting forms of energy supply. Bioenergy crops are plants grown and harvested to produce biofuels such as biodiesel or heat and electricity through direct combustion. Biofuel are considered renewable and climate-neutral because plants take in carbon during photosynthesis and this same carbon is released into the atmosphere when these plants are used as a source of energy. In spite of this, concerns that the cultivation of bioenergy crops can exacerbate land-use conflicts, especially by reducing arable lands for food crops, with far-reaching implications in a region with chronic problems of food scarcity, are on the rise.

We are developing an agent-based model to study land use conflict between food and bioenergy crop cultivation in Ghana's formerly Brong-Ahafo (i.e. Bono, Ahafo, and Bono-East) region. We will use the model to examine the extent to which farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha (a bioenergy crop) are influenced by their interaction with biofuel companies and other farmers through a common market where harvests are sold, the spatial land-use patterns that emerge from farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha and the implications of the obtained land-use patterns on food security (i.e. maize crop availability). The study is intended to be informative rather than predictive.
