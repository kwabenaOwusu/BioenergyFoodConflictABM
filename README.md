# *Bioenergy crops versus food crops: An agent-based modeling study of land-use conflict in Brong-Ahafo region, Ghana*

## Purpose
Over the past years, the government of Ghana drafted and planned to adopt biofuel policies such as financial instruments (i.e. biofuel subsidies) and regulatory instruments (i.e. biofuel targets and mandates) to support the biofuel industry. There are growing concerns that this projected growth in the biofuel industry can exacerbate the already existing food security situation in the country. We are developing an agent-based model to study land use conflict between food and bioenergy crop cultivation in Ghana's formerly Brong-Ahafo (i.e. Bono, Ahafo, and Bono-East) region. We will use the model to examine the extent to which farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha (a bioenergy crop) are influenced by their interaction with biofuel companies and other farmers through a common market where harvests are sold, the spatial land-use patterns that emerge from farmers’ decisions to cultivate jatropha and the implications of the obtained land-use patterns on food security (i.e. maize crop availability). 


The rising demand for energy in regions of Africa with rapid population growth associated to the dwindling of Earth’s current supply of fossil fuel and erratic rainfall patterns (making hydropower less reliable) pose a great challenge to the energy security of the continent. Bioenergy has been touted as a sustainable alternative to other more impacting forms of energy supply \citep{farrell2006ethanol, ragauskas2006path}. Bioenergy crops are plants grown and harvested to produce biofuels such as biodiesel or heat and electricity through direct combustion. Biofuel are considered renewable and climate-neutral because plants take in carbon during photosynthesis and this same carbon is released into the atmosphere when these plants are used as a source of energy.

Biofuels, however, are not completely carbon-neutral due to the energy required to transport materials and power the facilities used to produce biomass energy. Furthermore, bioenergy is promoted as a means to stimulate the development of Africa’s rural areas through job creation and secure incomes for farmers \citep{sawe2014socio, van2012jatropha}. In spite of this, concerns that the cultivation of bioenergy crops can exacerbate land-use conflicts, especially by reducing arable lands for food crops, with far-reaching implications in a region with chronic problems of food scarcity, are on the rise.

In Ghana, the main form of energy supply in rural communities is wood biomass (i.e. firewood and charcoal), which is a major contributor to global climate change \citep{duku2011comprehensive, kemausuor2011review}. The backbone of the economy, agriculture, is characterized by smallholder farmers (farmers hereafter) producing food crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, cassava, yams, plantain, groundnuts, cowpeas, cocoa, oil palm, and coffee. Ghana has also the right climate for growing the bioenergy crop \textit{Jatropha curcus} (\textit{Jatropha} hereafter) \citep{duku2011comprehensive}, although the promotion for the cultivation of this crop has been unsuccessful.

Previous studies have often focused on post-cultivation aspects, including biomass collection, storage, and transportation to power plants \citep{sokhansanj2006development}. Much less attention has been dedicated so far to the multidimensionality of the problem, involving land-use conflicts but also potential economic, ecological, political and social conflicts. With this proposal, I plan to investigate the competing interests between bioenergy companies and farmers and the factors that may drive Ghanaian farmer's decision to cultivate \textit{Jatropha} and the implications for food security in the country. More specifically, I will use a spatially explicit Agent-Based Model (ABM) to examine the consequences of different socio-cognitive behaviours of the different players involved. I will use the model as a computational laboratory for exploring scenarios that focus on the local farmers' adaptive responses to different socioeconomic conditions and the associated effects on food security. The study is intended to be informative rather than predictive.
